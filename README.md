# Green

Green Project
The Green project is a well-structured application that follows the principles of Clean Architecture. It is divided into several layers, each with a specific responsibility. Here's a breakdown of the layers and their roles:

Green.Domain
The Domain layer is the heart of the software, and this is where the business logic resides. It is the most essential part of the system and is independent of any specific technology or external application layers. It includes entities, domain events, and abstractions.

For example, the ChargeStation entity resides in this layer. It encapsulates the core business logic and rules for a charge station, such as changing its name, setting its group, and removing connectors. It also raises domain events when certain actions occur, such as when a charge station is removed.

Green.Application
The Application layer is responsible for orchestrating the application's workflow and does not contain any business logic. It coordinates tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain objects in the domain layer.

For instance, the CreateChargeStationCommandHandler in this layer handles the command to create a new charge station. It uses the repositories and unit of work from the domain layer to perform the task.

Green.Infrastructure
The Infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations of the abstractions defined in the domain layer. It typically includes data access implementations, file system interactions, network requests, etc.

For example, the ChargeStationRepository in this layer provides a concrete implementation of the IChargeStationRepository interface from the domain layer. It uses Entity Framework Core to interact with the database.

Green.API
The API layer is the entry point of the application. It handles HTTP requests and responses. It uses controllers to handle different routes and actions.

Design Patterns
The project uses several design patterns:

Dependency Injection: This pattern is used to achieve loose coupling between classes and their dependencies. It allows the system to be more flexible, testable, and modular.

Command Pattern: This pattern is used to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

Repository Pattern: This pattern is used to decouple the business logic and the data access layers in the application.

Unit of Work Pattern: This pattern is used to bundle several related operations into a unit so that all operations are either completed successfully or failed together.

Domain Events: This pattern is used to capture side-effects of changes in the domain in a loosely coupled way.

These patterns help to keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and scalable. They also make it easier to understand the code and find potential errors.
